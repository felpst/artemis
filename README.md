# CS305 Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution that is incorporating additional security into their already existing application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Testing potential vulnerabilities in the code via static testing. Secure coding is important to protect not only your property but also user's property. Personal information and trade secret loss can cause great harm to all involved. Secure software helps to guard information, helping also to protect a company’s reputation in the long run.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The dependency check tool was really helpful, it created a shortcut in detecting vulnerabilities compared to checking each dependency by hand.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Testing made it clear that most of the vulnerabilities were caused by the use of old libraries, therefore by updating them program got safer. Using penetration testing in the future will better assess additional vulnerabilities within the code.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Through coding the software while testing it in parallel, I continually ran debugs to ensure that it was functional. After refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The use of stack overflow to check how peers were solving situations similar to mine, especially when running into console errors.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
The use of a hash function to send encrypted communications.
